# Secure-Reddit
This project focuses on the development of a secure discussion forum, akin to a "secure Reddit," where discussions can take place with maximized confidentiality and privacy. The system is designed to ensure that only the intended group of participants can engage in discussions and access the content. 

2. Implementation and Design
System Overview: The secure discussion forum is meticulously crafted using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. The backend, developed with Express.js, is responsible for handling crucial functionalities such as user authentication, group management, and data transactions. The frontend is a React-based application that offers a user-friendly, terminal-like interface, facilitating seamless interaction with the system. The database is a MariaDB SQL.
2.1 Design and Workflow
1. User Registration and Key Generation: Upon registration, each user generates an RSA public-private key pair. This key pair forms the cornerstone of the forum's security infrastructure.
Public and Private Keys: The public key is shared with the server during registration and stored in the user's profile. It is used by the server and other users to encrypt data that only the specific user can decrypt.
The private key, crucial for decryption, is downloaded and stored locally on the user's hard drive. This design choice significantly enhances security, as the private key never leaves the user's device, thus reducing the risk of exposure during transmission or server-side breaches.
2. Authentication with JWT Tokens: After registration, users authenticate via login credentials. Upon successful authentication, the server issues a JSON Web Token (JWT).
JWT for Session Management: JWTs are used to maintain user sessions and authenticate subsequent requests. This token-based system is stateless and scalable, perfect for a distributed application environment.
The token is securely stored in an HttpOnly cookie, further protecting it from client-side script access and reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and also using https.
3. Group Creation and Join Requests: Users can create new groups or request to join existing ones. Each group has a unique identifier and an associated group key.
Group Key Management: When a group is created, a group symmetric key is generated of AES 256. This key is essential for encrypting and decrypting posts within the group. The group key is encrypted with the servers AES-CBC key.

When a user joins a group or is accepted into one, the server encrypts the group key using the user's public key and sends it to them. This ensures that only the intended user can decrypt and use the group key.
4. Storage of Encrypted Group Keys: The encrypted group keys are stored in the user's IndexedDB, a client-side storage solution.
IndexedDB for Key Storage: Leveraging IndexedDB allows for secure and efficient storage of encrypted keys directly in the user's browser. This aligns with the application's design philosophy of decentralizing data storage for enhanced security.
5. Creating and Viewing Posts: To create or view posts in a group, users must provide their private key. This step is crucial for the encryption and decryption process.
Encryption and Decryption of Posts: When a user attempts to create a post, the application uses the decrypted group key to encrypt the content before sending it to the server.
Similarly, when viewing posts, the application decrypts the content using the group key, which is decrypted with the user's private key.
Conclusion: This secure discussion forum's design intricately weaves together modern cryptographic practices with a user-centric approach. By decentralizing key storage, employing robust authentication mechanisms, and ensuring the confidentiality of communication through encryption, the platform stands as a testament to privacy and security in the digital realm.

2.2 Technologies
Node-Forge for Encryption and Decryption: All encryption and decryption processes in your project utilize the node-forge library, a powerful and versatile toolkit for cryptography. Node-forge is used for various cryptographic operations, including the generation of RSA key pairs for users, encryption and decryption of group keys, and secure handling of message content within groups. The choice of node-forge is significant due to its comprehensive support for modern cryptographic standards. It provides a range of functionalities from basic hash functions to advanced encryption algorithms like AES and RSA.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Implemented to control cross-origin requests, CORS is essential for securing the application against cross-site scripting and other cross-origin attacks. It restricts resources to interact only with authorized domains.

HTTPS with Self-Signed Certificate: The use of HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted, safeguarding against interception and eavesdropping. A self-signed certificate, while not ideal for public-facing websites, is sufficient for internal or private applications where trust can be established without third-party validation.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for Authentication: JWTs offer a stateless and scalable solution for user authentication. They are preferred over traditional session-based authentication for their ability to scale with distributed systems and their inherent security in handling user sessions.
HttpOnly Cookies: Storing JWTs in HttpOnly cookies enhances security by preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing the token, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
Private Key Storage on Hard Drive: Storing private keys on the user's hard drive, rather than on the server, decentralizes sensitive data storage, significantly enhancing security by reducing the risk of server-side data breaches.
Encrypted Group Keys in IndexedDB: Encrypting group keys with users' public keys ensures that each group's conversation remains confidential and accessible only to its members. Storing these keys in IndexedDB provides a secure, client-side database solution that integrates well with the frontend technology stack.
Rate Limiting: Rate limiting is crucial to protect the server from denial-of-service attacks and to ensure fair usage of resources among users. It helps maintain the application's availability and reliability, especially under high load conditions.
Data-at-rest Encryption: The incorporation of data-at-rest encryption primarily through the encryption of group keys. When group keys are created or accessed, they are encrypted before being stored in the database or IndexedDB on the client side. This ensures that sensitive data, particularly the keys necessary for decrypting group messages, remain secure even when stored.
Encrypting data-at-rest is crucial because it protects against unauthorized access to data if the storage medium is compromised. It adds a vital layer of security, ensuring that even if an attacker gains access to the stored data, they cannot decipher its contents without the corresponding decryption keys.
Input Validation and Sanitization: To mitigate the risk of injection attacks and ensure the integrity of the data, input validation and sanitization is used, especially in parts where user input is accepted, such as during registration, login, and post creation.
Input validation ensures that only appropriately formatted data is accepted (for example, ensuring usernames or group names adhere to specific patterns). Sanitization involves cleaning the data to strip out any potentially malicious content, like script tags or SQL code, which is vital for preventing XSS and SQL Injection attacks.
API Security: The project uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure API interactions. JWTs help in ensuring that the requests are authenticated and that the information exchange is between verified users and the server.
Furthermore, using HTTPS for communication and CORS policies adds additional layers of security to your API by encrypting the data in transit and restricting resource sharing to trusted domains, respectively.

The chosen technologies and design decisions for the secure discussion forum are rooted in a commitment to security, scalability, and user experience. Each element, from the programming languages to the security measures, are selected to create a cohesive, secure, and efficient platform for confidential discussions. These choices reflect the overarching goal of maximizing security and confidentiality while also maintaining a certain level of usability and performance.
